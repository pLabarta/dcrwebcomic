# DCR Time

01

Minimizing trust is about simple and cheap **verification**. What if there was a way to verify the past with just one click?

02

**DCR Time** is a free service that uses the Decred blockchain to **hash** and **time-anchor** files.

03

This can be used to **demonstrate** a particular file **existed** at or before the time it was anchored.

04

To minimize blockspace, a **hash** of each submitted file is calculated and sent to a **dcrtime server**.

These are then organized into **merkle trees**, and hashed down to **merkle roots** which are anchored **once an hour**.

05

DCR Time was originally built to timestamp data from **Politeia**, Decred's proposal system.

06

Now it can be used to timestamp **any kind of data**, and it even powers a Twitter timestamping bot.

07

With **verifiable proof** that documents have not been tampered with, communities **don't have to trust** the admins who run the servers. While often overlooked, this tech levels the playing field for online discussion.
