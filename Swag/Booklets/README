DCR Comic, now available to print!

These files were created for being used in events held by the community, or by anyone who wants them physically.

The files are presented in A3+ (329mm x 483mm / 12.95 x 19.02 inches), in which I obtained the best results.

Within each folder are .pdf's and .png's of each comic. A print test is recommended testing this two out. Personally, I found better results printing in .png, but usually each printer has different results.

Each file has its respective cutting guides, folding guides, and guides to test and correct the natural offset of the prints.
