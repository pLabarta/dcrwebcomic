# DIY DCR Comic booklets

These files were created for being used in events held by the community, or by anyone who wants them in a physical format.

The files are presented in A3+ (329mm x 483mm / 12.95 x 19.02 inches), which yielded the best results.

Within each folder are .pdf's and .png's of each comic. A print test is recommended testing this two out. Personally, we found better results printing in .png, but it depends on the printer..

Each file has its respective cutting marks, folding marks, and indicators to test and correct the natural offset of the prints.
