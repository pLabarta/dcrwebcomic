## Using the mobile app

Logging in from your mobile device requires you to setup the homeserver to "https://matrix.decred.org" in the Riot mobile app by checking the "Use custom server options (advanced)" box. If you don't have an account, create it using the guide above.

After logging in for the first time, your rooms list will be empty. To find Decred channels tap the top-right menu dots, then "Global Search", and browse Decred's rooms directory.
