# DCR Comic: new characters v0.1

As we pointed out in the second proposal, we are working on new characters for DCR Comic in order to avoid overusing Stakey and fill the gaps. We have worked on several new characters that represent various activities and systems that interact at Decred Project.

We are also working on the technicals to better fit Decred's brand and improve readability on mobile.

All feedback is appreciated.

## Technicals

We are reworking the comics so to improve readability on mobile devices. If you can read this on your phone and give us some feedback, that would be amazing.
