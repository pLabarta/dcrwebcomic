The Way of the Decred Contractor
by Crypto Rocket
& the Decred Community

02
A Decred community member has a great idea to push Decred's growth.

03
To bring it to life, he submits a proposal on Politeia, the governance platform.

04
The stakeholder community reviews the proposal.
Then, the author updates it and starts the voting phase.

05
The Voting Phase lasts 2016 blocks, close to a week.
20% of the live tickets MUST PARTICIPATE
60% of those tickets MUST VOTE 'YES'

06
Once the proposal is approved, the contributor can get to work!

07
As they deliver, the treasury pays them!
Now, they can continue to contribute to Decred's (r)evolution.
