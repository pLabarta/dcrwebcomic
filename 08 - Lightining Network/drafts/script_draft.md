Lightning Network is a 2nd layer network. It uses smart contracts in order to move transactions off-chain but retain the same guarantees that Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake enable in the base layer. 

# 02

Blockchains like Decred have to deal with limited blockspace. Increasing it might lead to make it impossible for the regular user to run it's own node.

# 03

The Lightning Network is not a "one-size fits all" solution. The original code had to be customized and ported to the Decred chain.

# 04/05

Off-chain, without the blockchain limits, transactions become almost instant and costless.

# 06

Two LN nodes can open a payment channel by publishing a special TX that creates the smartcontract.

# 07

Each must fund their side and once the channel is opened, they can instantly update the state as many times as required.

# 08

At any time, one party can close the channel by publishing the latest state to the blockchain. Each one gets their share of the contract.

# 09

Multiple interconnected channels create the Lightning Network, which can route payments between two users without them having to open a direct channel.

# 10

While it is not the grand solution to the scalability problem, and we might never find one, saving precious blockspace is an important piece of the puzzle. In the future, this technology could enable more than DCR payments, lowering the barriers to participate in governance and even creating bridges with other chains.
